"""
Workflow models are intended to track which step the student is in during the
assessment process. The submission state is not explicitly tracked because
the assessment workflow only begins after a submission has been created.

NOTE: We've switched to migrations, so if you make any edits to this file, you
need to then generate a matching migration for it using:

    ./manage.py schemamigration openassessment.workflow --auto

        If the status is done, we do nothing. Once something is done, we never
        move back to any other status.

        If an assessment API says that our submitter's requirements are met, or if
        current assessment step can be skipped, then move to the next assessment.
        For example, in student training, if the submitter we're tracking has completed
        the training, they're allowed to continue. Whereas in peer assessment, it is
        allowed to skip that step so we mark it as started and move to the next assessment.
        So all skippable steps are in progress until completed. But user can complete
        next steps before those skippable ones.

        For every possible assessments, we find out all skippable assessments and mark
        them as skipped and consider that step already started (calling `on_start` for
        that assessmet api). Then choose the next un-skippable step as current step.

        If the submitter has finished all the assessments, then we change
        their status to `waiting`.

        If we're in the `waiting` status, and an assessment API says it can score
        this submission, then we record the score in the submissions API and move our
        `status` to `done`.

        By convention, if `assessment_requirements` is `None`, then assessment
        modules that need requirements should automatically say that they're incomplete.
        This allows us to update the workflow even when we don't know the
        current state of the problem.  For example, if we're updating the workflow
        at the completion of an asynchronous call, we won't necessarily know the
