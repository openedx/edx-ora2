            Given the state of the world today, what do you think should be done to combat poverty?

            Read for conciseness, clarity of thought, and form.

                <explanation>
                    In "Cryptonomicon", Stephenson spent multiple pages talking about breakfast cereal.
                    While hilarious, in recent years his work has been anything but 'concise'.

                    If the author wrote something cyclopean that staggers the mind, score it thus.

                <explanation>
                    Tight prose that conveys a wealth of information about the world in relatively
                    few words. Example, "The door irised open and he stepped inside."

                <name>Neal Stephenson (early)</name>
                <explanation>
                    When Stephenson still had an editor, his prose was dense, with anecdotes about
                    nitrox abuse implying main characters' whole life stories.

                <explanation>
                    Score the work this way if it makes you weep, and the removal of a single
                    word would make you sneer.

                    Coolly rational, with a firm grasp of the main topics, a crystal-clear train of thought,
                    and unemotional examination of the facts.  This is the only item explained in this category,
                    to show that explained and unexplained items can be mixed.
