submissions, but also the state of the rubrics at the time those assessments
were made.

    one with the information OpenAssessmentBlock has passed in.

       Never change Rubric model data after it's written!

    The little tree of objects that compose a Rubric is meant to be immutable â€”
    once created, they're never updated. When the problem changes, we end up
